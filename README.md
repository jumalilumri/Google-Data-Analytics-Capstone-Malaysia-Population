# Google Data Analytics Capstone The Population of Malaysia
## Introduction
For my Google Data Analytics Capstone project, I choose Case Study 3: Follow your own case study path. For this option, I will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. I will answer the key tasks and the deliverables for each process given in the Case Study 3 packet.

## Data Analysis Process: Ask :question:
The business statement for this capstone is to analyze population trends of older adults (aged 60 and above) in Malaysia from 2014 to 2024 to assess the growth of the aging segment and evaluate potential healthcare demands. The insights aim to support public and private healthcare providers in planning for geriatric care services, chronic disease management, and senior-focused health policies.

## Data Analysis Process: Prepare :construction_worker:
For this analysis, I will be using the public data available from government agency, the Department of Statistics Malaysia. The link can be found [here](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/population_malaysia). The credibility of this data is high because it was released directly by a government agency. The data contains the population of Malaysia by sex, age group and ethnicity recorded from 1970 to 2024. Once I downloaded the data from the website I move to the next data analysis process.

## Data Analysis Process: Process :factory:

Based on my business statement, this analysis will focused on the older adults (aged 60 and above) age group from 2014 to 2024. Therefore, I would need to process my data to match the requirement.

My first step is to extract the requirement.

In this step, I extract the required year which is from 2014 to 2024. I also populate only require both for sex and overall for ethnicity because my focus is on the age group.

After extracting the required data, this is how it looks like.
